## 观众提问

重述一下问题是个聪明的办法，可以确认你是否理解了问题，同时，给自己一些时间来思考

- `That's an interesting question. How are we going to get voluntary redundancy?` 
- `Thank you. So you would like further clarification on our strategy?`

回答完毕后，确认提问者是否满意。

- `Does this answer your question?`
- `I hope this explains the situation for you.`

如果你不知道如何作答，就说不知道。承认无知总比妄自猜测要好

- `I'm afraid I'm unable to answer that at the moment. Perhaps I can get back to you later.`
- `That's a very good question. However, we don't have any figures on that, so I can't give you an accurate answer.`
